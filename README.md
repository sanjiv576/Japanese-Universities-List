### Notes
- **Language Medium**: "English" indicates fully English-taught programs; "Both" means programs offer English courses but may include Japanese options or require some Japanese for administrative purposes. Always confirm language requirements.
- **Other Details**: Programs like data engineering are often embedded in data science/AI curricula (e.g., via courses in big data processing). Contact universities for specifics on scholarships (e.g., MEXT), visa support, or curriculum details.
- **Ikebukuro**: Rikkyo University is directly in Ikebukuro. Other Tokyo universities are accessible (10–30 minutes by train).
- **Verification**: Program names may be broader (e.g., Computer Science) but include specializations in requested fields. Check websites for exact tracks, as offerings may evolve.
- **Contact**: Use university websites or email admissions for application details, TOEFL/IELTS requirements, or deadlines.
